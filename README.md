# Jammming
This project was build with React as part of the Codecademy Full-Stack Development course. This project lets user create Spotify playlists with a more playlist-oriented UI than spotify has.

# Technologies
This project uses the following libraries and APIs

- React
- Spotify API

This web app also uses cookies to store the playlist information between sessions so authentication with the spotify API does not delete all of the user's work.
